# AI-Powered-Intelligent-Insurance-Risk-Assessment-and-Customer-Insights-System
**AI-Powered Intelligent Insurance System**
This project aims to build an AI system to optimize insurance processes like risk assessment, fraud detection, and customer experience. 

**Key Features:**
Risk Classification & Claim Prediction: Predict high/low risk and claim amounts using supervised learning.
Customer Segmentation: Group policyholders for personalized plans using clustering.
Fraud Detection: Identify unusual patterns for fraudulent claims using anomaly detection.
Multilingual Document Translation: Translate insurance documents into multiple languages using transformers.
Sentiment Analysis: Analyze customer feedback to improve service.
Text Summarization: Summarize lengthy policies.
Text Generation: Develop AI assistants for customer queries.
Business Impact:
The system will address challenges like complex risk assessment, fraudulent claims, inefficient processing, and lack of personalization. Expected outcomes include increased revenue, reduced costs, improved operational efficiency, and enhanced customer experience.

**Technologies Used:**
Python libraries like TensorFlow, PyTorch, Scikit-Learn, and Hugging Face Transformers are utilized. SQL/NoSQL databases and cloud platforms (AWS/Azure/GCP) are also part of the tech stack.

**Data Sets:**
The project uses several datasets, including:

**Insurance Risk & Claim Dataset 
Customer Feedback & Sentiment Dataset 
Fraudulent Insurance Claims Dataset 
Insurance Multilingual Policy Document Dataset 
Customer Segmentation Dataset 
Each dataset undergoes specific preprocessing steps like handling missing values, encoding categorical data, feature scaling, and text cleaning.**

**Deliverables:**
Source Code & Implementation 
Comprehensive Project Documentation & Reports 
Trained Model Artifacts & Evaluation Results 
Optional: Deployment Files (API/Interactive Dashboard) 
Optional: Video Demo 

**Setup:**
Clone the repository, install dependencies from requirements.txt, and follow instructions in the scripts and notebooks folders for data preprocessing and model training.

**Final Success:**
Achieving 90%+ accuracy in risk classification and fraud detection, 40-60% reduction in claims processing time, detecting 70% fraudulent claims, and increasing customer satisfaction by 25% are key indicators.
